## DBMS - Overview
- A Database is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information.
- A database management system stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, manipulate, and produce information.
### Characteristics
- Modern DBMS uses Real-world entities to model its architecture, relation-based tables to allow understanding of architecture, separation of data and application, normalization to reduce redundant data, consistent relations, a query language to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data, ACID properties applied to transactions to keep the database healthy, multiuser support to allow collaboration, multiple views for different users, and security.
